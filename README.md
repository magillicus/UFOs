# UFOs

## Overview of Project
I helped Dana build an interactive website that allows users to filter through and search for recorded UFO sightings across the globe.

The above image demonstrates what a user sees upon navigating to the page. There are, however, filterable fields where someone can modify their query to view different subsets of UFO data.

Consider the adjusted filter below:

Let's say the user above didn't have criteria to fill in every field. They just read about a particular date in history where a UFO was spotted in Maryland. The following would be the results of their query:

## Summary

One potential drawback of this website is that all of the included data appears to be from January 2010. We need to update the website to include more data with other dates than those included. Aside from that and a few other quirks, the site is functional and provides users with information about UFOs they probably didn't have before.
